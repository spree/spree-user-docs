## Introduction

In order to assign Store Credits to the user's account you have to create **Store Credit Categories**. The category defines the reason the user received Store Credits to spend in your store.

To find **Store Credit Categories**, click on the **Configuration** dropdown and look for the **Store Credit Categories** option.

## Creating a New Store Credit Category

There's now a simple way to create a new Store Credit Category. You can do it by pressing the **New Store Credit Category** button in the upper right corner.

There is only one input box to define the new category you will create. Simply input the name and press the **Create** button.

## Editing and Deleting Store Credit Categories

The previously created Category is visible in the Store Credit Categories settings. You can now create more categories or make changes to existing ones. As in every other section of Spree, you can see **Edit** and **Delete** buttons next to the name of each category.

You can now assign Store Credit to the users' accounts. You can learn more about it [here](/user/users/editing_users.html)
