### [Introduction](reimbursement-types.md#introduction) <a id="introduction"></a>

To make it easier for you when you need to make a reimbursement, there are various reimbursement types that help you define what kind of return to give to the customer \(e.g store credit, credit card or exchange for a new item\).

### [Creating a Reimbursement Type](reimbursement-types.md#creating-a-reimbursement-type) <a id="creating-a-reimbursement-type"></a>

You simply open the **Configuration** tab and press **Reimbursement Types**. Now, you can see all previously set up types, with the possibility to add a new one.
