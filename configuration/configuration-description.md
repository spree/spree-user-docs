# Configuration\(Description\)

The Configuration page of the Admin Interface is the area of your store where you can implement decisions regarding your desired store set up. This is where you decide which shipping methods you offer, which categories you assign to products, how you want the currency displayed, and dozens of other settings.

The guides in this section will walk you through all of those configuration decisions and show you how to customize your Spree store to best fit your particular needs.
