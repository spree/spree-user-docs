# Store Credit Categories

### [Introduction](store-credit-categories.md#introduction) <a id="introduction"></a>

In order to assign Store Credits to the user’s account you have to create **Store Credit Categories**. The category defines the reason the user received Store Credits to spend in your store.

To find **Store Credit Categories**, click on the **Configuration** dropdown and look for the **Store Credit Categories** option.
