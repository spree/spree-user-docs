# Payments \(Description\)

Processing payments for orders is a very important component of your Spree store. The flexibility of this system allows you to add, remove, or change [methods of payment](payment-methods.md) to suit your needs, as well as to use almost any [payment gateway](payment-methods.md#add-a-supported-gateway) you prefer.

The guides in this section will also help you to understand the [states an order goes through](payment-states.md#payment-states) from the time the first item is added to the cart, to the moment you close out the fulfillment process.
