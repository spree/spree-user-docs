#### [Store Credits](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/user/users/editing_users.html#store-credits) <a id="store-credits"></a>

Firstly, to add store credit to the User, you have to create a **Category** which you can learn more about [here](../configuration/store-credit-categories.md). Once you create a category you can assign Store Credit to the Users by simply clicking **Edit** on a certain User and pressing **Store Credit** in the right panel.

![User edit inside](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/816e7d5b65fa7a8b15f94ae16e075950/b9b0e/store_credit_user_add.jpg)

You will see the **Store Credit** panel. As with every other tab in the User’s account you can see **Lifetime Stats**.

![Store Credit panel](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/e02573d3eefa910547955cc5656c0afc/03ffe/store_credit_user.jpg)

To add Store Credits press **Add Store Credit**.

At this point, you can choose the value that the User will receive, set the category and put any important information within the **Memo** field. The memo field is visible to all other admins that will edit Store Credits added by you. Press the **Create** button to accept your changes or press **Cancel** to exit without saving the changes.

You can now see how the Store Credit is assigned to the user. New options are visible here:

* **Credited** - Value that shows how many Store Credits have been added to the User account.
* **Used** - Amount of Store Credits spent.
* **Category** - Category that Store Credits were assigned to.
* **Created By** - The Admin’s email that added Store Credits to that particular User.
* **Issued On** - Date of granting Store Credits.

As an Admin, you can edit or delete Store Credits previously assigned to the User.

![Store Credit Delete](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/b8154354e298e193b5d59effa8a4d733/7d1e4/store_credit_user_added_delete.jpg)

Editing Store Credits will present you with the same options as adding them.

![Store Credit Edit Inside options](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/0d3d237d0cfcaf3396eb0b2e9f0cac07/eef13/store_credit_user_added_edit_inside.jpg)

Store Credits are visible to the User in a few places during checkout. It’s worth mentioning that the User is not forced to use Store Credits during the Payment process - the Spree default. Spree gives users the choice to pay full price with Credit Card or use Store Credits.



![User&apos;s choice](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/52ce8f584170ac56c4c7a3e0645c160b/86143/store_credit_front_apply.jpg)

Once the user decides to use the Store Credits there is the possibility to cancel this choice.



![User&apos;s choice to remove](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/5c860489843b29f1808178eb530972f1/3a93b/store_credit_front_applied.jpg)

If the user uses Store Credits and the amount does not cover whole value of the order, the rest will be charged to Credit Card or PayPal.



![Information about Credit Card and Store Credits](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/4bbf45b913d8f8c4d6e2e7c2903c7c0a/6f5f0/store_credit_front_confirm.jpg)

Once the order has been placed there is a recapitulation of the order. The user can see the following: **Billing Address**, **Shipping Address**, **Shipment method**, as previously chosen by the user; **Payment Information** including how much store credit, if any, has been assigned to the order; and **Items purchased** along with information about order’s payment.

![Placed order](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/c28bf1e93e5a5f901fd91f1b35b91dd1/b9b0e/store_credit_front_placed_order.jpg)

As an Admin you are able to check how the user paid for the order. Simply choose the order that you would like to inspect and go to the **Payments** tab. If you don’t know where to find this tab you can find out [here](../orders/manual-order-entry.md). Admins have to capture payments manually by default. In order to enable Automatic Payment Capture for the future payments we strongly recommend reading about it [here](../payments/payment-methods.md).

![Admin panel Payments](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/static/68df05c409cef69036071e7db5fc8145/b9b0e/store_credit_order_paid.jpg)

Also as an Admin you can observe used Store Credits in **Users -&gt; Store Credits**.
