# Users \(Description\)

The User page of the Admin interface is the area where you store all the data of users that have ever created an account in your store. In this tab, you can create users, set their roles, and edit and delete them.

The guides in this section will walk you through the user tab and show you how to customize your Spree users:

* [Create a User](creating-a-new-user.md)
* [Search Users](searching-users.md)
* [Edit an User](editing-users.md)
* [Delete an User](deleting-users.md)
