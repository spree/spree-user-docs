Deleted products no longer appear in the customer-facing area of your store. However, they do remain in your product database. To view products that have been deleted from your store, go to the “Products” tab in the Admin Interface and find the “Search” section. Do not enter anything in the “Name” or “SKU” fields. Check the “Show Deleted” box and click “Search”. The search results will return a list of your entire product inventory including active and deleted products.
