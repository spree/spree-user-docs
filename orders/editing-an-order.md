# Editing an Order

## [Introduction](editing-an-order.md#introduction)

There will be times when you need to edit orders that are placed in your store. Some examples:

* A customer may call you to adjust the quantity of items they want to purchase.
* You may sell out of an item and need to remove it from an order altogether.
* You may need to change the shipping being charged on an order.
* The customer may have store credit which you need to manually apply to their order.

First, go to your Admin Interface. Click the “Orders” tab, and [locate the order](searching-orders.md) you want to change.
